# FZP-TDK Github Repo


## The Goal

This is a project which aims to produce an **intuitive, easy to use** playground for **diffractive** and **holographic systems**. Built (currently) on the backbone of **[diffractsim](https://github.com/rafael-fuente/diffractsim)**, the amazing work of **Rafael Fuente**. By giving his python script a modern(ish) Graphical interface, I aim to lower the entry level into analysis of diffractive optical phenomena.  


## The program

Coded entirely in `Python`, with `Qt6` for the graphical interface, and the above mentioned **[diffractsim](https://github.com/rafael-fuente/diffractsim)** working behind the scenes. For a functional local copy, it is necessary to install all the required packages. A standalone executable is ***planned*** for future release, but my experience with portable, truly standalone `Python`-based executables is lukewarm at best.

# Important disclaimer

The program began in *March 2025* as a quick, local collection of command-line scripts to support my research. In *October 2025* I started expanding it for presentation at the Scientific Student Conference (**TDK**) and nominated the program for my semester project in the course *Szoftverfejlesztés MI támogatással*. Because the project will be publicly accessible, I **rewrote it from scratch** to produce a cleaner, maintainable codebase; **it includes AI-assisted code.**

<br/>

*Ths repository is migrated from a private one, therefore the very early versions are not tracked.*
