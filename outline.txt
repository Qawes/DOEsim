Python GUI application using QT6, for the purposes of utilizing "diffractsim" library graphically. 
The app should consist of three scripts: main.py, gui.py, and engine.py. main is responsible for launching the gui, gui is the frontend facing the user, and engine in the backend, to which all actual calculation requests will be sent. 

A mockup of the  app's layout can be found in "Mockup Main Window.png" and "Mockup Optical vis.png", but a short summary is:
- Menu bar (Toolbar)
  |-- File
  |   |-- New
  |   |-- Save
  |   |-- Load
  |-- Edit
  |   |-- Options
  |-- Help
  |   |-- Help
  |   |-- About
- Tab window - separated by a resizable split container (Working area with tabs on top, to switch workspaces, children are of such a tab)
  |-- working area, with values to enter, and two large image containers separated by a split container (resizable), a solve button under each image
  
TODO:
FEAT - add fifth column (another value)
     - for lens it is convex / concave -> manage automatically with negative f values
     - for aperatures it is inverted or not, and a second radio between all other aperatures - is this unknown -> reverse propagation
     - for screens first value is is it range or single
     - for screens second value is two numbers: length, and interval between screens

FEAT - add screen as an element into table, and handle it in engine
     - this means the screen image area needs to have a way to switch between the different screens
     - single screens obv means a png, range means gif / mp4

MISC - resizing while calculating images hides "calculating" and shows previous image (pr text)
     - make polychromatic selection text unavailable
     - add closing button to workspace tabs
     - add renaming option to workspace tabs
     - some numberfield should allow for zero values
     - numberfields with a non zero minimum should jump to a whole integer from minimum value (eg. 0.01 -> 1, not 0.01 -> 1.01)
     - disable scrollwheel in elements table, add this to Options, by column
     - make table row numbers start at 0
     - make table number column wider
     - add generate names when type changes boolean to options
     - add deletion warning boolean to options
     - add option for replacing os.getcwd() with a permanent path
     - add defaults for monochromatic, wwavelength, extents, resolution
     - add default element offset (10mm) to options
     - rename distance to placement (?)
     - possibly add an option to use relative distances instead of placement - Add moving arrows to elements
     - add setting for auto highlighting all values when clicking into numberfields

AI Model experience:
- GPT 4.1 (free model) adequate, can code with very strict and explicit instructions
- Sonnet 4.5 (paid) Limited usage, due to frequent slowdowns / loops. For every edit it goes aroud multiple times for a file, always forgetting newlines. Maybe Python language issue? Creates lots of files, tries to run cmd scripts, even if explicitly told not to.
- GPT 5 (paid)

GUI tests: in order:
- create new workspace and rename it (Testing)
- close old default workspace (Workspace 1)
- change wavelength to 440, extents to 6mm, resolution to 128
- add an aperture, a lens, and a screen, then one-by-one delete them
- add an aperture, a lens, and a screen, then delete them all at once by selecting them with their table index
- add an aperture, rename it to fzpelem, change distance to 0.01, change image to "aperatures\20250320 00_11_58 manual pattern.png"
- add lens, rename it to gyujto, change distance to 3, change focus to 800
- add screen, rename it to lemezkep, change distance to 0.01
- add screen, rename to lencsekep, change distance to 1000
- add screen, rename to kep, change distance to 1000, delete screen lencsekep
- click solve button under screen
