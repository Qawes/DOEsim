TODO:
FEAT - add fifth column (another value)
     - for lens it is convex / concave -> manage automatically with negative f values
     - for aperatures it is inverted or not, and a second radio between all other aperatures - is this unknown -> reverse propagation
     - for screens first value is it range or single
     - for screens second value is two numbers: length, and interval between screens

MISC - go over name change error tooltip
     - possibly add an option to use relative distances instead of placement - Add moving arrows to elements
     - simulation should not run when aperture with empty path is present
     - underflowing spinbox limit forces element to switch places .\bug.mkv
     - add path option for sim_results folder
     - localization . and , 
     - clamp numberfield value to min/max instead of rejecting it
     - light gray as bg
     - apertures override each other - some finicky workaround is needed :(
     - investigate aperture rotated 180deg
     - opening pref while solution is done and gif playing crashes
     - test for renaming things with illegal chars and bad names (duplicate, empty, short, etc.)
     - move imports and DEFAULT to top if possible


AI Model experience:
- GPT 4.1 (free model) adequate, can code with very strict and explicit instructions, good for smaller implementations, and finding functions hidden somewhere in the project. also doesnt eat into the budget
- Sonnet 4.5 (paid) Limited usage, due to frequent slowdowns / loops. For every edit it goes aroud multiple times for a file, always forgetting newlines. Maybe Python language issue? Creates lots of files, tries to run cmd scripts, even if explicitly told not to.
- GPT 5 (paid) Slow, sometimes takes really long, not too verbose with every step its doing. Usually manages to solve the query, doesnt generate infinite files. Just invisible (positive)
